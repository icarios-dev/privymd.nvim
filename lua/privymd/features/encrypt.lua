--- @module 'privymd.features.encrypt'
---
--- Feature-level module handling encryption of GPG code blocks.
---
--- This module provides high-level functions for encrypting one or several
--- fenced GPG code blocks inside a Markdown buffer or any text content.
--- It relies on lower-level utilities from `privymd.core.block` and
--- `privymd.core.gpg` for block manipulation and GPG process handling.
---
--- The encryption process is transparent for the user: encrypted blocks
--- replace their plaintext content directly in the buffer or in-memory text.
---
--- Example:
--- ```lua
--- local Encrypt = require('privymd.features.encrypt')
--- local text = {
---   '````gpg',
---   'my secret note',
---   '````',
--- }
---
--- local recipient = 'user@example.com'
--- local result = Encrypt.encrypt_text(text, recipient)
--- vim.print(result)
--- ```
---
--- Each block detected as a GPG code fence will be encrypted using the
--- configured recipient. The function automatically updates the buffer or
--- returns a new text table, depending on the call context.

local Block = require('privymd.core.block')
local Gpg = require('privymd.core.gpg.gpg')
local log = require('privymd.utils.logger')

local M = {}

--- Encrypt a single fenced block within text.
--- Replaces the plaintext content of the block with its encrypted form.

--- @async
--- @param block GpgBlock Block to encrypt
--- @param recipient string GPG recipient identifier (email, key ID, etc.)
--- @param text? string[] Optional text table; if provided, a new table with
--- the encrypted block replaced is returned instead of modifying the buffer.
--- @return string[]? updated_text Returns the updated text if `text` was given,
--- or `nil` when operating directly on the active buffer.
--- @return error? err error message

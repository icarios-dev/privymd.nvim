INTRODUCTION                                              *privymd-intro*

PrivyMD is a Neovim plugin for editing Markdown files that contain
GPG-encrypted text blocks. It transparently decrypts and re-encrypts
those regions while keeping the rest of the document readable.


==============================================================================
FEATURES                                                  *privymd-features*

  - Transparent encryption/decryption
  - Automatic decryption on open
  - Automatic encryption on save
  - Passphrase cached per session


==============================================================================
SETUP                                                     *privymd-setup*
  Default settings:

      >lua
      require('privymd').setup({
        auto_decrypt = true,
        auto_encrypt = true,
      })
      <

USAGE                                                     *privymd-usage*

Each Markdown file must define a GPG key identifier (`gpg-recipient`) in its
*YAML front-matter*. Text regions that should be encrypted must be wrapped
inside fenced code blocks using the `gpg` language:

  >markdown
  ---
  gpg-recipient: user@fake.io
  ---

  Visible text

  ````gpg
  Secret content...

  ````

  Visible text


==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                  *privymd-commands*

*:PrivyDecrypt*

  Manually decrypt all GPG blocks in the buffer


*:PrivyEncrypt*

  Manually encrypt all GPG blocks in the buffer


*:PrivyToggle*

  Toggle encryption/decryption of the block under cursor


*:PrivyMDClearPass*

  Clear the cached GPG passphrase for the current session

*:PrivyShowBlocks*

  List all detected GPG code blocks (debug)

GPG DECRYPTION LOGIC                                    *privymd-gpg-decryption*

PrivyMD relies on your local GnuPG configuration (~/.gnupg) to encrypt and
decrypt GPG blocks embedded in Markdown files.

KEY STRUCTURE

A standard GPG identity consists of:
- a *master key*, protected by a single secret passphrase;
- one or more *subkeys* used for specific operations:
  - signing (S),
  - encryption (E),
  - authentication (A).

The encryption subkey is the one used to decrypt GPG blocks. It can be renewed
or revoked over time, but it always remains tied to the same master key — and
thus to the same passphrase.

DECRYPTION PROCESS

1. Detect encrypted block
   PrivyMD identifies the `-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----` sections and passes
   their content to GnuPG.

2. Analyze recipients
   GnuPG inspects the message to determine which public keys it was encrypted
   for. If one of your private keys matches, it will be used to decrypt the
   content.

   NOTE:
     In its current version, PrivyMD always encrypts blocks for a *single*
     recipient key (the one available in your local keyring).
     While GnuPG fully supports decrypting messages addressed to multiple
     recipients, PrivyMD does not yet support encrypting to several keys at
     once. This is a planned improvement for a future release.

3. Request passphrase
   If your private key is protected, GnuPG prompts for the passphrase of your
   *master key*. Once entered, gpg-agent caches the key in memory for the
   session.

4. Successful decryption
   The encrypted block is replaced in memory with its decrypted content. If no
   matching key is found or the passphrase is incorrect, the block remains
   unchanged.

SPECIAL CASES

- Multiple recipients:
  A GPG message may be encrypted for several keys. If one of them belongs to
  you, decryption will work normally.

- Multiple master keys:
  Rare but possible. In that case, GnuPG may ask for different passphrases
  depending on which key is used. PrivyMD does not handle this case yet.

- Revoked or expired subkey:
  If a message was encrypted with an older subkey, GnuPG will warn you. The
  decryption still succeeds as long as the corresponding private key is
  available locally.
